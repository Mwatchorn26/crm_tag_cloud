TAG CLOUD SEARCH FILTER
=======================

This module is supposed to provide a Tag Cloud (as part of the search view drawer) showing all the various category ids (categ_id) available in the module.

The tag cloud is essentialy a filter. There was no other means for regular users to quickly see which categories were available for filtering on.
